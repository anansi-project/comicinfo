This helps to differentiate languages with multiple scripts, like Traditional and Simplified Chinese.

### StoryArcNumber

 While `StoryArc` was originally designed to store the arc _within a series_, it was often used to indicate that a book was part of a reading order, composed of books from multiple series. Mylar for instance was using the field as such.
 
Since `StoryArc` itself wasn't able to carry the information about ordering of books within a reading order, `StoryArcNumber` was added.

`StoryArc` and `StoryArcNumber` can work in combination, to indicate in which position the book is located at for a specific reading order.
